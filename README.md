coreLib
=======

This is code written agaisnt the API of our ChMS (Church Management Software) to provide helper functions to make it easier to do common tasks such as add people, update communication records, add custom attributes, etc.

This uses a piece of core code from the ChMS software company, then I created my own extensions for it.
